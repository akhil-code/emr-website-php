  "projectDescription":"A neural network is analogically similar to network of neurons in a human brain, and a trained network can be made to imitate human brain. The network shown in the video has been trained on 5000 hand written numbers and has achieved an accuracy of 97.52%. The image of a randomly selected image from a set is shown on the right side and the most probable prediction is shown in the terminal on the left side",
