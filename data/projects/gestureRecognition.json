  program detects 7 hand gestures: the traditional “Yo!” sign, “call” sign,
   “click” sign, “hold” sign, “stop” sign and tilted hands(with degree of tilt)
   with astounding accuracy. It can even be used to control a robotic arm when
    a gesture is detected and made to look like a hand imitator",
